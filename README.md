# kittehsq.github.io

<p>even smaller html5 website</p>
<p>second html website, took 10 hours to complete the index.html, thanks again, w3schools!</p>
<p>once again, the word "cta" doesn't mean anything special, it's just a misspelling of cat that has become popular in the Grapejuice Linux community. (that one roblox on linux wrapper)</p>

# running

<p>the website is confirmed to work on firefox 78-100 by just double clicking on index.html or visiting the github pages version.</p>
<p>like the last one, this website is also designed for the ubuntu font family, though if not on your computer it'll just load up any sans serif font you got on your pc.</p>

# html design guidelines

<p>if you're gonna add something, use plenty of comments, i personally don't care about a few bytes per addition dedicated to making the website maintainable!</p>
</p>if you're going to add something, make it fit in! (you CAN use JavaScript, though personally i'd rather it be HTML since i only know css and html.)</p>
