  discord. ohhh discord. i have been a user of discord since christmas 2017, where i got my first desktop. fond memories.
  <br>
  but the thing is, discord sucks. here's why.
  <br>
  discord nowadays has a facebook-like one-account-per-person setup where people make an account, get banned, and move on. but what if you have friends? they stay on discord and continue buying their shitty subscription service and such, while you are left behind and resort to another platform. though this usually wouldn't be an issue, discord currently also is basically the only free platform where you can just text chat and voice call with up to 10 members in a single application. this is a problem for me, because finding alternatives has been tricky. i have been very vocal about how much i would like to switch to fully matrix, but the thing is, when people find one thing, they stick to it forever. i have tried for almost a year to get my friends to switch to matrix, and out of around 6 of them, one has made an account, and barely uses it. another issue i have with discord is its apparent distaste for third party clients. with other platforms like irc, sms, cellular calling, and matrix, there is no 'one' client, each one has up and downsides, but with discord, you are stuck with one horrendous client that hogs up to 4 gigabytes of memory on linux, uses an old version of electron without wayland support, and did i mention it uses electron? an entire other web browser, using up resources 24/7. in this age where the average ram size is 8 gigabytes, is it not strange that having windows use up 3 gigabytes, and discord using another gigabyte only leaves you enough ram to play triple a titles from 7 years ago? i am also dissapointed how people put up with an 8 MEGABYTE file upload limit unless, of course, you pay 10 dollars a month for their subscription service which gives you 100 megabytes. i have no idea how people put up with 6 floppy disks worth of uploads in a time where the average game takes up around 100 gigabytes, and the average hard drive is 10 times that. and to mention that, did you know on matrix you can upload 100 megabytes for no cost at all? goodness, how i despise discord.
